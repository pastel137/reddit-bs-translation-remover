# Userscript for easy removal of translated posts/switching back to original
Annoyed by reddit's poorly translated posts on google? You already have everything set to English, but google still manages to show you that bs? Look no further. This short script removes ?tl=xx from URL and replaces it with ?show=original.

It doesn't affect the equally bad google search results, but you get straight up original posts as soon as you click on the google result. 

All you need is some client side code loader, I prefer Tampermonkey. 
Hope this helps.
